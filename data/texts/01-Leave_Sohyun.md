Some memories stay in objects. A scorch on the wall from a microwave that sat too close. Tiles that peeled off easily in the shower. A wooden frame, worn by years of damp. A note in his grandfather’s handwriting, one of many small things left behind. These weren’t meant to be saved—or even seen. They were things usually hidden behind walls, under surfaces, or quietly thrown away. But during the renovation of Seokho Shin’s childhood home, he chose to keep them—not for their function or value, but for the way they held memory: traces of use, habit, and time embedded in their surfaces.

The house itself was built by his parents with limited resources. It was repaired continuously over time, often with quick or temporary fixes. Cracks were patched, surfaces layered over one another, but the underlying structure—what gave the house its stability—was rarely addressed. The result was a home that held together visually, but remained fragile beneath. Over time, those surface repairs became part of the story: visible layers of damage, change, and quiet persistence.

In Leave, Shin brings these fragments together into a new form—fragile, exposed, and unresolved. Installed inside Under Depot, a half-sunken space visible only through a single window at ground level, the work appears just out of reach—framed like a memory, seen but not entered. This perspective reinforces the nature of the materials themselves: salvaged, partial, and never fully revealed. Shin doesn’t restore or conceal them, but lets them remain as they are—materials shaped by time, wear, and memory.

What emerges is a skeletal form—assembled from what was never meant to be seen. Each fragment is left in its original condition: softened, warped, scorched. This structure doesn’t recreate a home. Instead, it gathers what’s left—unfinished, uneven, and quietly held together by memory.
