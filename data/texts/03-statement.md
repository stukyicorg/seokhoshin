My work explores the boundaries between the physical and digital realms, questioning our perception of reality in an increasingly connected world.

Through various mediums, I seek to create experiences that challenge conventional thinking and invite viewers to see the world from new perspectives.

*Art is not what you see, but what you make others see.*

The intersection of technology and traditional craftsmanship opens new possibilities for expression that were previously unimaginable.
