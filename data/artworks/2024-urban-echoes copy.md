An abstract representation of city life, capturing the rhythm and chaos of urban environments through geometric forms. The concrete base represents the foundation of modern civilization, while the iron elements reach upward like architectural aspirations.

This piece explores the contradiction between human desire for order and the inherent chaos of urban living. The rough texture of concrete contrasts with the refined geometry of the iron components, creating visual tension that mirrors the urban experience.
