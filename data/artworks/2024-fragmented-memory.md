A sculptural exploration of memory and time, where fragmented bronze pieces represent the scattered nature of human recollection. This work delves into the philosophical concepts of how we process and store memories, using the inherent properties of bronze to symbolize permanence while the fragmented structure suggests the incomplete nature of remembrance.

The interplay between the rigid steel framework and the organic bronze elements creates a dialogue about structure versus chaos in our mental processes.
