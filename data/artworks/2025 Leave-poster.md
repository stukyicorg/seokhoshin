‣ 《간다》 철거된 집의 자재

‣ 《Leave》 Fragments from a demolished house

dimensions variable

## detail

 작년 말, 건축 일을 하는 아버지가 설계하여 지은 20년 된 집은 골조만 남기고 뜯겨 나갔다. 
표면을 뜯어내자 내장 구조재들이 우루루 쏟아져 나왔다.
 
20년, 벽 하나를 사이에 두고 이토록 가까이 살았는데 한 번도 본 적 없었던 싸구려 각목 구조물이 얼기설기 붙은 채로 폐기 처리되었다.  
그동안 궁금하거나 그 형상을 떠올려 본 적도 없었던 내장재들과의 대면은 갑작스러웠다.
나의 유년기와 이십 대를 숨어서 지탱해 왔던 물리적 실체를 확인하는 것은 생각보다 자극적이었다. 
그냥 쓰레기로 둘 수 없어 하나 둘 골라내고 먼지를 터는 순간, 나는 이것으로 무엇인가 할 수밖에 없는 사람이 되었다. 장마마다 비가 새는 집이 싫었는데, 이제 와서 뭔가 붙들 것이 있는 것처럼 추억의 폐기물 앞에서 전전긍긍했다.
 
나는 이것들을 작업실로 가져와 파괴된 구조의 일부를 살리고 내 손으로 구현할 수 있는 물리적 질서를 만들었다. 사라진 것을 기억하고 들여다볼 수 있는 것으로 바꾸어 두면 나이 지긋한 20년 후에 비로소 다시 보일테니.

Some memories stay in objects. A scorch on the wall from a microwave that sat too close. Tiles that peeled off easily in the shower. A wooden frame, worn by years of damp. A note in his grandfather’s handwriting, one of many small things left behind. These weren’t meant to be saved—or even seen. They were parts usually hidden behind walls, beneath surfaces, or quietly thrown away. But during the renovation of Seokho Shin’s childhood home, he chose to keep them—not for their function, but for the way they held memory: traces of use, habit, and time embedded in their surfaces.

The house itself was built by his parents with limited resources. Over the years, it was held together by makeshift repairs—quick fixes layered to keep the surface intact. Cracks were patched, materials reused, but the underlying structure—what gave the house its stability—was rarely addressed. The result was a home that held together on the surface but remained fragile underneath. Over time, these repairs became part of its story: visible layers of damage, change, and quiet persistence.

In Leave, Shin gathers these remnants into a new form—fragile, exposed, and unresolved. The work sits inside Under Depot, a half-sunken structure originally built to store and project media works. Unlike Turn Depot—the tall, translucent tower across the park, where stored works remained constantly visible—Under Depot was designed for its surface. Its long horizontal glass wall functioned as a projection screen, casting images outward while keeping the interior concealed. For this exhibition, the screen shifts to transparency, revealing the inside for the first and final time. Seen only through this ground-level window, the installation appears flattened and distant, like a paused image—echoing the nature of the materials themselves: salvaged, partial, and never fully revealed.

Shin doesn’t restore or elevate the fragments. He leaves them as they are: scorched, warped, softened. His method echoes his father’s—working with what’s available, making temporary repairs to keep things intact, if only for a while. This way of making mirrors the logic of the space itself: built to store what no longer had a place, now briefly transformed into a site of display.

As the final chapter of the Love Your Depot project, Leave returns to the Depot’s founding question: what remains after an exhibition ends? Shin’s installation offers a personal response—what’s left behind when a home is dismantled, when an artwork is no longer in circulation. In this final moment, a private history becomes public—before both the home and the Depot project prepare to leave.
