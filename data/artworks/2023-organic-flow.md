A harmonious blend of natural materials exploring the relationship between organic and geometric forms. The smooth marble surface flows seamlessly into the textured wood, creating a dialogue between refined and raw natural elements.

This work investigates the boundaries between nature and human intervention. The careful balance between the two materials suggests that harmony can be achieved when we respect rather than dominate natural forms.
